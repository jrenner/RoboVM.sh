RoboVM.sh
=========

Use RoboVM from the command line, IDE agnostic

##About

The default file is an example of how to use a shell script to run RoboVM to compile a libgdx + kotlin project

The script is written so that you may easily understand it and change it to suit the needs of your project.
It could easily be modified to work with any Java project, or other JVM languages, by modifying variables in the script.

Pull Requests are welcome.
